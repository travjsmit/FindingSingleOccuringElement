The intent behind this program is to identify the element within a sorted array that only appears once, while achieving O(log n) time complexity.

The problem at hand involves finding a single-occurring element in a sorted array where all other elements appear exactly twice. The solution requires a time complexity of O(log n), which suggests the use of a binary search algorithm. Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that halves the search space in each iteration, thus achieving a logarithmic time complexity.

The function FindSingle starts by defining two pointers, low and high, representing the lower and upper bounds of the search space. Initially, low is set to the start of the array, and high is set to the end of the array. The function then enters a loop, which continues until low is less than high.

Inside the loop, the function calculates the mid index by averaging low and high. It then checks if the mid index is even or odd. This is crucial because, in the given array, every pair of identical elements starts at an even index and ends at an odd index. Therefore, the position of the mid index relative to the pairs of elements provides a hint about the location of the single-occurring element.

If the mid index is even, the function compares the mid element with the next element. If they are the same, it means the unique element is on the right side of the mid element, so the function updates low to be the next element after the pair. If they are not the same, it means the unique element is on the left side of the mid element, so the function updates high to be the mid index.

If the mid index is odd, the function compares the mid element with the previous element. If they are the same, it means the unique element is on the right side of the mid element, so the function updates low to be the mid index plus one. If they are not the same, it means the unique element is on the left side of the mid element, so the function updates high to be the mid index minus one.

This process continues, halving the search space in each iteration, until low is not less than high. At this point, low is the index of the unique element, so the function returns the element at the low index.

The primary hurdles encountered during the development of this solution were predominantly related to syntax, iterative testing, error identification, and subsequent resolution. The knowledge I acquired from the Big O course proved to be instrumental in constructing the preliminary framework of the code. This foundational understanding facilitated the creation of an efficient algorithm that adheres to the principles of time complexity. In the final stages of development, I leveraged the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence to scrutinize and refine the code. This utilization of AI not only enhanced the accuracy of the code but also ensured its robustness, thereby culminating in a solution that is both effective and reliable. This journey from conceptualization to realization underscores the iterative nature of coding, where continuous learning, application, testing, and refinement go hand in hand. It also highlights the transformative role of AI in augmenting human effort, making it a valuable ally in the realm of programming.
